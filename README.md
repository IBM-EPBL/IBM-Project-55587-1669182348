PROJECT OVERVIEW :
The airport codes may refer to either the IATA airport code, a three-letter code that is used in passenger reservation, ticketing and baggage-handling systems, or the ICAO airport code which is a four-letter code used by ATC systems and for airports that do not have an IATA airport code.
 
PURPOSE:
To provide better Airline and AirPort services and to avoid delays in Air Travel across different locations at Municipality level. The aim is to provide airports, airlines, and the travelling public with a neutral, third-party view of which airlines are delivering on their promise to get passengers from Point A to Point B on-time.
